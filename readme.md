### Description

This web app was created to help users easily keep track of their own, and their friends, progress through tv shows. Users can join as many different groups as they like, with each group tracking any number of tv shows, allowing users to stay caught up with all of thier friends. This helps to avoid spoilers and provoke better conversation about show events as users can always see where their friends are in relation to themselves.

### Using BingeSync

To use the app, users must initially create an account using the "Add User" button on the home screen (at the time of this project, nothing had been learned about encryption/security, so use of a real password is not advised). Once a new user has created they can login and navigate to the "Add Shows" page using the navbar at the top of the home page. Here users can add all of the shows that they wish to track, at which point they can go back to their home page (by clicking the BingeSync logo on the navbar) and begin to mark the episodes they have watched. To fully utilize BingeSync's functionality, users then can create or join groups with their friends by navigating to the "Manage Groups" page. Here, all current groups are displayed with the ability to join them, as well as an area to create a new group. Once a user is in at least one group, they can they navigate to the "View Groups" page where progress through each show tracked by each group is displayed with color coding to show personal progress vs. group progress (green = caught up, red = you are behind on that episode, grey = you are ahead on that episode).

### Future Features
With additional time to work on this project, we would have liked to incorporate an API that would allow us to link to Netflix / Amazon Video. Our desired functionality would include allowing users to click on an episode that they have not watched and be navigated to the viewing service of their choice, automatically starting the episode that they clicked. In addition, upon completion of the episode their profile would automatically updated to show that episode as watched.
